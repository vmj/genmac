genmac - Generate a random MAC address

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'genmac' [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
genmac generates a random MAC address, according to options.

OPTIONS
-------
genmac accepts following options.

-l::
-local::
        Generate a locally administered MAC address, as opposed to
        globally unique MAC address.  This is the default behaviour.
        If both '--local' and '--global' are used, one that comes last
        in command line options takes precedence.

-g::
--global::
        Generate a globally unique (OUI enforced) MAC address, as
        opposed to locally administered MAC address.  If both
        '--local' and '--global' are used, one that comes last in
        command line options takes precedence.

-u::
--unicast::
        Generate a unicast MAC address, as opposed to multicast MAC
        address.  This is the default behaviour.  If both '--unicast'
        and '--multicast' are used, one that comes last in command
        line options takes precedence.

-m::
--multicast::
        Generate a multicast MAC address, as opposed to unicast MAC
        address.  If both '--unicast' and '--multicast' are used, one
        that comes last in command line options takes precedence.

-6::
--eui48::
        Generate a EUI-48 MAC address, as opposed to EUI-64 MAC
        address.  This is the default behaviour.  If both '--eui48'
        and '--eui64' are used, one that comes last in command line
        options takes precedence.

-8::
--eui64::
        Generate a EUI-64 MAC address, as opposed to EUI-48 MAC
        address.  If both '--eui48' and '--eui64' are used, one that
        comes last in command line options takes precedence.

-V::
--version::
        Print version and exit with zero status.

--usage::
        Print usage and exit with zero status.

--help::
        Print help and exit with zero status.
