genmac provides a program for producing a random MAC address.
You can specify, via command line options, what kind of address to generate.

== Basic usage

The program http://www.linuxbox.fi/~vmj/genmac/genmac.1.html[genmac(1)] produces a single MAC address.
Following shows a typical invocation:

----
$ genmac --local --unicast --eui48
----

== Requirements

At runtime, standard C libraries.

To compile, CMake, a C compiler and standard C headers are required.
CMake will generate platform specific build files, so platform specific build environment is required.
For Unix type of systems like Linux, a 'make' command is enough.

To rebuild the documentations, AsciiDoc and xmlto are required.
On Debian based systems, you can install `asciidoc` and `xmlto` packages.
On Slackware, `linuxdoc-tools` contains both the `asciidoc` and `xmlto` tools.

== Installation (from source)

Download and extract the source distribution.
This project is using CMake as the build tool.
To build and install the project, issue the following commands:

----
$ mkdir build     # <1>
$ cd build        # <2>
$ cmake ../       # <3>
$ cmake --build . # <4>
$ make install    # <5>
----
<1> Create an out-of-source build directory
<2> Change the current working directory to the new directory
<3> Generate the platform specific build files (the '../' is the path to the extracted source; it does not have to be the parent directory as in the example above)
<4> Build the project
<5> Install the binaries and documentation

By default, the binaries are installed in '/usr/local/bin'
and the manual is installed in '/usr/local/man/man1'.

In order to install in some other prefix than '/usr/local',
use the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` cache variable in step 3 like so:
`cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ../`.
The 'bin' and 'man' paths under the installation prefix can also be changed
using the `BINDIR`, `MANDIR`, and `MAN1DIR` cache variables.
Their value must be relative to the installation prefix.

During the installation (step 5),
a staged installation can be achieved by defining the `DESTDIR` environment variable.
For example: `make install DESTDIR=/tmp/package-genmac`.
